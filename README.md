# CSU Groundwater Data Explorer
Colorado State University's Libraries Archives and Special Collections Groundwater Data Collection includes more than 20,000 digitalized objects, of which more than 3000 are field data sheets containing handwritten measurements of groundwater levels. 
These measurements were taken routinely at each groundwater well, some starting in the early 1950's and going as late as the mid 1960s.

To assist with discovery of the items in this collection, the overprint field maps were scanned and georeferenced using [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/).
These maps were then used in combination with the township, range, and section information of the field data sheets to geolocate them.

A feature rich web map was created using this enriched metadata, which can be embedded as part of the (main collectionâ€™s landing page)[https://archives.mountainscholar.org/digital/collection/p17393coll166].

Special thanks to Lilly Perez, Lucas Roy, and Connor Siegfreid for georeferencing and geolocating these data.
